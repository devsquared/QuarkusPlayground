# QuarkusPlayground

Messing around with the new framework [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/). 
This framework allows for some supersonic java that is container native.
Plan is to look at AWS Lambda as a potential way to deploy small, cloud-native java 
applications. 

For now, I am messing around with hooking into a postgresql database
and adding entries from a REST endpoint. Then, we can have fun
messing around with what all Quarkus can do. :)
